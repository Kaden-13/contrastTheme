Growing up I played sports such as: `Basketball`, `Football`, and `Baseball` and in doing so I've had a lot of opportunites to travel and expirience new things. Places I have been to include California, Idaho, Vegas, and Arizona. Sports in my opinion teach you a lot about how a family should function, how you need to talk/treat the people around, and how to work hard for what you want.

When I was a kid in grade school from around 3rd grade - 6th grade, I had around 5 major injuries. Some still affect me today. Although, not significantly like most people would think. Now, my first injury that started it all was a [Buckle Fracture](https://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/fact_sheets/Fracture_care_buckle_injury/#:~:text=A%20buckle%20fracture%20in%20the,heal%20quickly%20without%20any%20problems.) that I got messing around on a tramp and tried to cath myself when I was bounce around 15 feet in the air by my older brother and his friend. After that came a [Torn Achilles](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/achilles-tendon-rupture/symptoms-causes/syc-20353234) I got from my friend landing on the back of my foot when he was trying to be funny and jumped on me, while i was getting up. Next, I happend to [Hyperextend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22481-hyperextended-knee#:~:text=A%20hyperextended%20knee%20is%20an,place%20and%20help%20it%20move).) my elbow and broke two bones and barely missed my [Growth Plate](https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/growth-plate-injuries#:~:text=The%20growth%20plate%20is%20the,longer%20than%20they%20are%20wide.). Those are the most painful out of them, but I had two major [Concussions](https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/basics/concussion_whatis.html#:~:text=Print-,What%20Is%20a%20Concussion%3F,move%20rapidly%20back%20and%20forth.) that absolutely are the scariest of them, because concussions can cause permanent brain damage or damage your memory retention.
